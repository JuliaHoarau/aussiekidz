        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p class="about-p">
            After years of supporting various well known kids charities, Aussie Kidz Charity was started in early 2000
            by a group of individuals disheartened by watching an increasing percentage of donations being used to cover
            overheads instead of going to the ones who need it most, the Kids
        </p>
        <p class="about-p">
            We are focussing on gaining support and donations through the generosity of Directors, individuals,
            corporations, estate trusts and through various yearly fund raising activities.These includes the Mercedes
            Benz Polo Championships held each September and a Brisbane Businessman’s lunch held each November.Aussie
            Kidz Charity has received the Australian Taxation Office endorsement in May2001 to allow donations over $2
            to be tax deductible.
